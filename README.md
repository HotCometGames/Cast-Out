This repo was created to showcase the current state of this project, which is about a month into development at the time. At this state of the game procedual terrian generation, item gathering, mob spawning and basic attack systems, structure generation, and minimal item progression has been added. Going further, I will create more monsters, items, structures, develop a death and respawn mechanic, devolp a building mechanic, deveolp a crafting system, and anything else I seem fit. The devolpment will be posted on my youtube channel, hotcometgames, and hopefully the first devlog will be posted on the coming week. These devlogs will be used to build a comminity, and take community ideas.
