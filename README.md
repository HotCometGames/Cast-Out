This repo was created to showcase the current state of this project, which is about a month into development at the time. At this state of the game procedual terrian generation, item gathering, mob spawning and basic attack systems, structure generation, and minimal item progression has been added. Going further, I will create more monsters, items, structures, develop a death and respawn mechanic, devolp a building mechanic, deveolp a crafting system, and anything else I seem fit. The devolpment will be posted on my youtube channel, hotcometgames, and hopefully the first devlog will be posted on the coming week. These devlogs will be used to build a comminity, and take community ideas.

Most of the updates today can be seen in the unity editor, and not in code, however, there were slight code changes, like making certain attacks spawn on the ground, changing how the fireball works, and adding debugging movement to the player movement. Most of the work today was done making new attacks for the enemies in the editor, I made an earthquake attack, a ice shard attack, and reused the fireball for the fireling. Today I also uploaded my first devlog, the reaction seems to be positive, at around 160 views at 10pm tonight. Hopefully future devlogs will see growth!
